# Calculator App

A simple calculator app for Android built using Java in Android Studio. This app supports basic arithmetic operations: **Addition**, **Subtraction**, **Multiplication**, and **Division** with a clean and minimal user interface.

## Features

- Perform arithmetic operations:
  - Addition (`+`)
  - Subtraction (`-`)
  - Multiplication (`*`)
  - Division (`/`)
- Clear the display using the **Clear (C)** button.
- Displays results instantly after pressing the **Equals (=)** button.
- Handles division by zero with an appropriate error message.

## Object-Oriented Design

The app follows **good object-oriented design principles** by separating arithmetic operations into individual classes:
- `Add.java`
- `Subtract.java`
- `Multiply.java`
- `Divide.java`

Each class implements the operation logic using the **operate(int, int)** method.
